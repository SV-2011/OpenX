# Git
Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)

## Version Control
- Program that tracks changes to a collection of files
- Track all the different revisions 
- Recall to earlier version (rollback to working code)
- Allow several team members to work on same file, at same time without affecting each other's work

1. See Changes (when & why & who) made them
2. Each change Explain the reasoning behind it
3. Create **Branches** - Experemental Changes (Features, Bug Fixes, Security)
4. Every small change make a commit, better to fix problems
5. **Merge** the changes, you want to keep in main branch 
6. Delete the branch

## Distributed Version Control
Git is Distributed
Project complete history is stored both in the Client and the Server.
Edit without Network Connection, you have a local copy if server goes down
Push to remote server, when connection available.

### Command line 

Github Desktop & VS Code other interfaces work differently and have limitations with implementing all git functionality 

Git Command line works same, no matter the OS
Use all Git Functionalities

### Git vs Git Hub
#### Git 
multiple developers & other contributors work with one or more local branches and push them to remote repository

#### GitHub 
Cloud platform with Git core technology
simplifies collaborating on projects 
provide a website
more command line tools

#### Features
